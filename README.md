# Django
Developed a dynamic website using Django.
In the webapp folder you can check the whole code for the website i have developed.
The 'mysite' folder contains the home page and the 'accounts' folder contains the login and register pages.
Website developed is a food blog, where indian food is shown.The templates of all pages were directly downloaded.
The website is dynamic because by login in the Django administration page you can directly add more dishes on the page without actual coding.
All the data is directly stored in the posgresql database.
The screenshots are attached in the 'Django webapp SS' folder.
